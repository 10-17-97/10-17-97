 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
No matter what, I can't erase it.
I'm sorry for the lonely echo from my heart.
So if that's the case and it won't disappear,
I had an idea that it would be good to draw over it.

So that the black, black crack would disappear,
So that they wouldn't be visible, I quickly moved my pen and the tears running down my face.
I wanted to hide it, no, I thought I could hide it.

I should have done that.
I should have forgotten it.
It looks so easy to open up like that.
Why?
Why?
Why?
Why?
Despite me asking, the answer never arrives.

A new game where I'll remain even more weak.
Surely this game of punishment will continue.
From now on, what should I do, I wonder?
Since then, have I changed even a little?

We mixed the light when our mood was down.
Why? Why? Even though we're still weak.
In order to definitely meet, so that we won't be apart.
It shines, it shines. Sleepless 25:00.
